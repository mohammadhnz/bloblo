Developed a flight service using microservice architecture, with an authorization service implemented in Golang and a ticket
  service in Node.js, designed to handle queries and panel page requests.
Integrated the microservices with gRPC for efficient communication, ensuring robust and seamless interaction between
  authorization and ticket services.
